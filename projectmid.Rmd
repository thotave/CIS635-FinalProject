## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
```
```{r}

library(caret)
library(data.table)
library(ranger)
library(MASS)
library(caTools)
```


```{r}
data=read.csv("creditcard.csv")
```
```{r}
head(data)
```
Checking for any missing values
```{r}

sum(is.na(data))
```
No missing values found. Now we need to scale the 'amount' variable and we split the data
```{r}
data$Amount=scale(data$Amount)
```
Splitting the data
```{r}
set.seed(50)
split=sample.split(data$Class,SplitRatio=0.80)
train = subset(data,split==TRUE)
test = subset(data,split==FALSE)
```
Checking dimensions
```{r}
dim(train)
```
```{r}
dim(test)
```
